# Fixing the Mariner 1

[![All Tests](https://travis-ci.org/juliankrispel/mariner-1.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/juliankrispel/mariner-1)

## What's 'the Mariner 1'?
Never heard about the most expensive bug in history? [The Mariner 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariner_1) was the first vessel of the Nasa Mariner project. It was on a flyby mission to venus but had to be destroyed 2 minutes after launch.

## So what has a Nasa project to do with this github repo?
I'm (ab)using that singular historical event as background for a conference talk. This is the end-result of the live-coding exercise which is part of the talk.

In it we're creating a launching and steering interface for the Mariner 1, with tests, to make sure that it actually works :)
